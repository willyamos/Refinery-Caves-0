# Refinery-Caves-0
A simple text-based adventure game made for Object-Oriented Design (CPSC3175). Very basic. Not packaged as an executable, runnable in the terminal of Visual Studio. (yikes)

You, the player, explore two simple cave systems and "mine" different ores or collect different items to sell for cash. 
Buy access to a new cave or a new way of transportation for upgraded storage and carrying capability. 
Investigate the rumor of the mines and solve an overarching puzzle to "win".

Most of the commands in this "game" are made to meet requirements or extra credit opportunities for the class assignment it was made for.
We made a 95% (out of 1000 points) :D!
The points lost were from certain workarounds for communication to the player or scripted scenes such as shop communication or the tutorial. We know we could've done it better, but A LOT was cut out of this project due to our strict time constraints.
